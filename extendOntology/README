This project utilized maven as it's build system.  Most of the library
dependencies are handled via maven, but a few jars are from libraries that have
not been mavenized yet.  

To install these jars into maven, run 

./add_non_maven_jars.sh

Then, build the entire project with

mvn package

This will create two jars in target: extendOntology-1.0.jar and
extendOntology-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar.  To run any of the mains provided
without maven, include both of these jars in the classpath.
