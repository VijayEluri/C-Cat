The C-Cat library provides libraries for large scale text processing using the
hadoop framework.  It's ultimate goal is to provide tools and libraries for
automatically customizing a wordnet ontology based on the contents of a
particular corpus.  

It is structured into three sub-modules:
1) extendOntology-core: This provides a core set of text and collection like
classes.  
2) extendOntology-wordnet: This provides core wordnet libraries for reading,
writing, and modifying the wordnet hierarchy along with several synset
similarity metrics and several word sense disambiguation algorithms.
3) extendOntology: This is the complete package that includes both the core and
wordnet submodules.  On top of the two modules, it includes a text
pre-processing framework for documents stored in HBase.  This is the most
unstable module and is under heavy development.
